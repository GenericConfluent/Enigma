# Enigma

This repository is basically a redo of a failed enigma machine that I attempted
to create a year ago when I was new to C++. It was a project that was too
ambitious for my skills at the time. So I left the project and decided to just
work on improving my skills in the language. Then I forgot about it. On April
26, 2019, I was looking through my repositories(most of which are private) I
saw it and thought I ought to attempt redoing it. This is that attempt, so if
you feel like it download the code yourself and explore it.

# 2023 Update
Again it's been a couple years since I took on the enigma challenge and so now
after having done a couple hundred programming puzzles I thought I'd give it a go.
Except this time, I gave myself 30 minutes to add my fixes and edits.

Which did not go according to plan. I accomplished less in 30 minutes than I
had hoped to so I went like 2 hours over time. Also it basically became a
layered shift cipher instead of an enigma machine. But it's neater now, so I'm
happy.
